<p>The Lucy Collective - Women Of History will be one of two sites built on  the same technological structure with different visual style. The second will be Women Of Fiction, about women in movies, books, comics etc.</p>
<p>What you currently see is a interactive demo (maybe the right word would be “prototype”). Its goal is to plan the data structure, layout, user interaction and design, which will then serve as a reference when building the final working website.</p>
<p>I was inspired to create this page by the combination of my interest in history and the problem of unequal representation of women (and other non-privileged social groups) in media. The pragmatic fact is that women made up 50% of human history - and yet, many historical summaries seem to be strings of men with a lone woman interspersed here and there, and the stories based on them are even more egregious. We tell stories about knights and adventurers, detectives and cowboys and astronauts and all of them seem to be men - while in reality, even the most male-dominated field has a history of women working in it.</p> 
<p>While there is quite a large amount of information about historical women, searching for it takes time and a knack for writing effective google queries. This is what a database such as this should make easier.</p>
<h3 id="about-tlc">About The Lucy Collective</h3>
<p>The Lucy Collective is currently only a concept existing only on paper. “collective” is a word describing a group of like-minded people working on a common goal, which is precisely what The Lucy Collective will hopefully become. Its goal will be promotion of stories about women, by women. It will maintain the two sister sites and any other projects related to it, and interact with a larger community through social media.</p>
<p>The collective takes its name from Australopithecus Afarensis Lucy. I wanted the group to have a patron that would symbolize our shared humanity. I would have used Eve for the poetic license, but Islam, Judaism and Christianity are all exclusionary monotheisms and it would make that something of an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Lucy is almost just as iconic, and much less complicated.</p> 
<h3>Notes on some words used</h3>
<p>It’s probably a good idea to clarify some terms used throughout this site.</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>woman</strong> on this site refers to the gender, and a lose definition of it. Transwomen, ciswomen, drag queens, crossdressers, and people whose gender just can’t be specified from what we know about them all have place on this site. I do not think it’s worth it to stick to a narrow definition (e.g. just cis- and transwomen) just for the sake of consistency, when the people who wouldn’t fit into that are even less likely to be written about than “usual” women.</p>
<p>The pages show whether the women are <strong>women of color</strong>, <strong>LBTQA</strong>, and <strong>women with disabilities</strong>, and the search makes it easy to show only some of these groups. The point of this is to avoid treating “white, straight, cis, able-bodied” as a default, because that often leads to erasure of these identities, and that in turn worsens the position of women who belong to these categories. I am aware that the borders of these categories are blurry, but in my opinion the visibility is worth the potential arguments.</p>
<p>All of the above has a root in the problem of applying contemporary social constructs on history. On one hand, it’s nonsense; on the other, we tell these stories now and we can’t avoid thinking about them in the framework of our experiences. So, here we are.</p>
